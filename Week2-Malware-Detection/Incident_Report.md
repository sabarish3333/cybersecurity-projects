📌 Incident Report – Malware Detection Using Windows Defender and Splunk
1. Incident Overview

On 02/09/2026, a malware simulation was conducted using the EICAR test file to evaluate endpoint detection and SIEM monitoring capabilities.

Windows Defender detected the malicious file and generated security alerts, which were collected and analyzed using Splunk.

2. Environment

Operating System: Windows 10 (Virtual Machine)

SIEM Tool: Splunk Enterprise

Endpoint Protection: Windows Defender

Attack Simulation: EICAR Test File

3. Detection

The malware activity was detected by Windows Defender and logged under:

Event ID: 1116 (Threat Detected)

These logs were ingested into Splunk after configuring log permissions.

4. Analysis

Splunk was configured to monitor Defender Operational logs.

Search queries were used to identify malware events:

index=* EventCode=1116


The results showed threat detection timestamps, file paths, and actions taken.

5. Response

The infected file was quarantined.

System was scanned.

Permissions were adjusted to enable SIEM ingestion.

Logs were reviewed for further compromise.

6. Lessons Learned

Endpoint logs are critical for malware detection.

SIEM tools require proper access configuration.

Windows permissions can affect log visibility.

Centralized monitoring improves response time.

7. Conclusion

This project demonstrated hands-on experience in endpoint monitoring, SIEM configuration, and malware incident investigation.
